// What we get with frameworks:
// WEB SERVER - Frameworks either embed or integrate with specific web server. This is what handles the actual communication over HTTP.
// It makes sure it can handle many requests at once and serve many clients
// ROUTING - An HTTP request specifies resources it wants through headers. A framework allows developers to define what code gets run based on resource requested.
// They usually allow you to partially match URI to keep things dynamic
// REQUEST AND RESPONSE OBJECTS - Frameworks usually give you very reach request and response objects that are representations of the HTTP requests and responses.
// These object make it very easy for you to check if header exists, or handle normal HTTP status code
// TEMPLATING - Most pages have surrounding style and only little bits of dynamic data. Instead of writing all those bits in a string idea of templating is used.
// Most frameworks allows you to snap in different templating languages to build pages and push in just the dynamic bits into surrounding HTML

// The import allows the java programmer to access classes of a package without package qualification.
// The static import feature allows to access the static members of a class without the class qualification.
// The import provides accessibility to classes and interface whereas static import provides accessibility to static members of the class.
// in this example if we would import only class Spark, and no static, we could use get with Spark.get. We cannot import static only on class has to be on method of the class
